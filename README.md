# FizzBuzz (TDD Practice)

This is a simple FizzBuzz implementation created as a practice exercise in **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

## 🧪 Purpose

The main goal of this project is not the FizzBuzz logic itself—it's to practice writing **clean, maintainable tests** that:

- Guide the design of your code
- Are **not tightly coupled** to implementation details
- Allow for **safe refactoring**

## ✅ What It Does

Prints the numbers from **1 to 100**, with the following rules:

- For numbers divisible by **3**, print `"Fizz"`
- For numbers divisible by **5**, print `"Buzz"`
- For numbers divisible by **both 3 and 5**, print `"FizzBuzz"`
- For all other numbers, print the number itself

## 🔁 Refactoring Focus

This project explores how you can:

- Start with the simplest test that works
- Refactor logic as you go
- Keep your tests green (passing) throughout
- Avoid tests that break when implementation changes, but behavior doesn’t

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Language: C#
- Testing Framework: [xUnit]
